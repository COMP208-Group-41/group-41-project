Just putting a few notes in here of things I find during implmentation of event-edit.
Note alot of code I have reused from event-creation.php and also venue-edit.php

As I do not have access to the file store I will be leaving those functions as stubs. Will need to be implemented by you. Although I imagine it will work similar to the venue-edit.php code

I have also altered the HTML form ALOT to make it similar to event-creation with extra features such as image and tags fields! These Changes have also been made to event-edit.html

I will also make some suggestions belwo on how we could restructure our code more efficently and many functions I have used are very similar to those in other files and could be added to config.php

Note in cases where I have added functions to config.php I have left the orignals in place
See below

BELOW ARE MY SUGGESTIONS

function getVenues($venueUserID,$pdo) ADDED to Config.php but remains in event-creation.php

validateVenueName($name) should proberbly be renamed validate255($input) or similar as it isn't only used to validate venue names but could be used to validate any 255 size input string

EVENT_CREATION.PHP
